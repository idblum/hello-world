Imma Git You

Ok good, so you've decided to open the readme file! That means you not only know how to read english (good for you!) but you can also follow simple instructions (good for me!). Inside this repository you will find all the files necessary to analyze my data for various publications. Some are small snippets of code for manipulating files, others are monstrous scripts for analyzing various types of rhythmic data.
